This repo serves as a guide to understanding the intiail building blocks of creating a project that requires the use of multiple technologies, whilst being fully unit/integration tested. The aim to ensure all code is kept to a standard so we have full control when it comes to testing, which will be enabled by using design patterns and following the SOLID principles when it applies to be beneficial.
